It's a tool which is easy to use to request http request.

The framework contains common http action: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE. Any one who used this tool should generate a class implemented corresponding http action's base class. And the caller who at activity or any main thread only concern the onSuccess and onFail methods. The framework use java Generic, so it apply any object which make it more reuseable.
